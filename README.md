# Welcome to Feature-Sliced Design!

This repo is a starter for completing the tutorial. It's an [Indie Stack][indie-stack] Remix app, slightly tweaked for convenience.

To run the app, use the `dev` script:

```
pnpm dev
```

To make sure your code is in check, use the `validate` script:

```
pnpm validate
```

To see the solution, check out the `solution` branch.

To see the changes that have been made to the original Remix app, check out the [commit history][commit-history].
